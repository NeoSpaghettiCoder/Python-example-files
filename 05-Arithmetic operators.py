# print(a*b)            # Multiplication

# EXTERNAL OPERATORS # 
# print(a%b)              # Modulo operator
# print(a ** b)           # Power operator
# a+=b                    # Assignation (works with all primary operators)

# a = 5.0                 # Need variable as float type
# a/=b                    # Now it can be divided
